09/09/2025 - Hopefully this is how the tech stack will look !
Frontend: react + typescript + Vite
UI: tailwind + shadcn/ui (figma to help layout design, components of shad give me prebuilt but also able to make big changes)

By the end of ^^ should have a working ontes app that makes all the implementable
aspects I want (Add notes, delete, zoom, resize, highlight, tree, nesting). 

Next step is allowing the notes to save (database) ((this is persistence)), move across devices (sharing), 
isolate notes between users (useauth oauth, password collection ((maybe connect to google)) and WAY into the future integration to mobile

backend (haven't started); nodejs ((i think is very popular and already using TS so makes sence))
heard of prismORM for postgres integration with data, dont know how to use though but i understand the concept


Database (future): SQLite in the beginning so I can see if I can even make a note app that saves

Deployment: Supabase  + ??? vercel (same guy that built shadcn so probably no issues)

Expecting one month of work on this project :P hopefully I learn a lot and have something I am proud of
